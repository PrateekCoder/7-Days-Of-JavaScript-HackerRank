/*
James found a love letter his friend Harry wrote to his girlfriend. Being a prankster, he decides to make some fun adjustments to it by changing each of its words into palindromes.

To do this, he follows two rules:

He can reduce the value of a letter (e.g.: he can reduce d to c, but can't increment c to d).
A letter can be reduced more than once, but once it is reduced to a it becomes locked at a and its value can no longer be changed.
Each reduction in a letter's value is counted as 11 operation. For each test case, find the minimum number of operations required to convert the given string to a palindrome.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, TT (the number of test cases).
Each of the TT subsequent lines contains a single string of lowercase characters.

Constraints
1≤T≤101≤T≤10
1≤1≤ length of string ≤104≤104
All characters are lowercase English letters.

Output Format

For each test case, print a new line with the minimum number (as an integer) of operations required to convert the given string to a palindrome.

Sample Input

4
abc
abcba
abcd
cba
Sample Output

2
0
4
2
Explanation

Test Case 0: abc →→ abb →→ aba. We print the number of operations, 22, on a new line.

Test Case 1: abcba is already a palindrome. We print the number of operations, 00, on a new line.

Test Case 2: abcd →→ abcc →→ abcb = abca. Then abca →→ abba. We print the number of operations, 44, on a new line.

Test Case 3: cba →→ bba →→ aba. We print the number of operations, 22, on a new line.
